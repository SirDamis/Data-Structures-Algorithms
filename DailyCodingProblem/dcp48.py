"""
Given pre-order and in-order traversals of a binary tree, write a function to reconstruct the tree.

Example: Given the following preorder traversal: [a, b, d, e, c, f, g] and the following inorder traversal
[d, b, e, a, f, c, g]. You should return the following tree.
                        a
                       / \
                      b   c
                     /\   /\
                    d e  f g
